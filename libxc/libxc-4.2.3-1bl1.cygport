SUMMARY="Library of exchange and correlation functionals to be used in DFT codes"
DESCRIPTION="libxc is a library of exchange and correlation functionals. Its purpose is to
be used in codes that implement density-functional theory. For the moment, the
library includes most of the local density approximations (LDAs), generalized
density approximation (GGAs), and meta-GGAs. The library provides values for
the energy density and its 1st, 2nd, and (for the LDAs) 3rd derivatives."
