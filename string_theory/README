string_theory
------------------------------------------
String Theory is a flexible C++11 library for string manipulation and storage.
It stores data internally as UTF-8, for ease of use with exiting C/C++ APIs. It
can also handle conversion to and from UTF-16 and UTF-32, and has a variety of
methods for easier text manipulation.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-3.0.7-1
  libgcc1-7.4.0-1
  libstdc++6-7.4.0-1
  libstring_theory-devel-2.2-1bl1
  libstring_theory2-2.2-1bl1
  pkg-config-1.6.0-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  autoconf-13-1
  automake-10-1
  binutils-2.29-1
  cmake-3.14.5-1
  cygport-0.33.1-1
  gcc-core-7.4.0-1
  gcc-g++-7.4.0-1
  ninja-1.9.0-1

-------------------------------------------

Build instructions:
  1. unpack string_theory-2.2-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./string_theory-2.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/string_theory-2.2-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/string_theory-2.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libstring_theory2-2.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libstring_theory-devel-2.2-X.tar.xz
