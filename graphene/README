graphene
------------------------------------------
When creating graphic libraries you most likely end up dealing with points and
rectangles. If you're particularly unlucky, you may end up dealing with affine
matrices and 2D transformations. If you're writing a graphic library with 3D
transformations, though, you are going to hit the jackpot: 4x4 matrices,
projections, transformations, vectors, and quaternions.

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-2.10.0-1
  girepository-GLib2.0-1.54.1-1
  libglib2.0-devel-2.54.3-1
  libglib2.0_0-2.54.3-1
  libgraphene1.0-devel-1.8.2-1bl1
  libgraphene1.0_0-1.8.2-1bl1
  pkg-config-0.29.1-1

Build requirements:
(besides corresponding -devel packages)
  binutils-2.29-1
  cygport-0.31.1-1
  gcc-core-7.3.0-3
  gobject-introspection-1.54.1-1
  meson-0.46.1-2
  ninja-1.8.2-2

Build instructions:
  1. unpack graphene-1.8.2-X-src.tar.xz
  2. if you use setup to install this src package,
     it will be unpacked under /usr/src automatically
        % cd /usr/src
        % cygport ./graphene-1.8.2-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/graphene-1.8.2-X-src.tar.xz
  /usr/src/graphene-1.8.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libgraphene1.0_0-1.8.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/libgraphene1.0-devel-1.8.2-X.tar.xz
  /usr/src/girepository-Graphene1.0-1.8.2-X.tar.xz
