SUMMARY="Variety of supported compression methods"
DESCRIPTION="Libwandio is a software library written in C that provides an API for
transparently reading from and writing to files using a variety of supported
compression methods. Provided pthreads are available, I/O performance will be
improved by doing any compression and/or decompression using a separate
thread."
