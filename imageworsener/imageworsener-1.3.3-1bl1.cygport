SUMMARY="Cross-platform command-line utility for image processing"
DESCRIPTION="ImageWorsener is a cross-platform command-line utility and library for image
scaling and other image processing. It has full support for PNG, JPEG, BMP
formats, experimental support for WebP, read-only support for GIF, and limited
support for some other image formats. It's not as fast or memory-efficient as
some utilities, but it's very accurate."
